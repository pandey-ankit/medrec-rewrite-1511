<p>Java EE provides a big picture for enterprise application development, but in many cases, developers may find some
  limitations. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some Java EE APIs are flexible, but they do not provide enough abstraction and are too low-level for daily
    use.
  </li>
  <li>Standard Java EE does not include easy-to-use functionality for certain scenarios, architectures, or patterns.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, MedRec is implemented using simple reusable components on top of Java EE APIs, covering common
  technical features such as messaging, persistence, cache, integration testing, naming, and so on. These <code>common
    components</code> significantly ease the application implementations that follow the architecture, described in
  <a href="javascript:reloadTOC('design-overview.html')">Design Overview</a>, and also enforce the use of best
  practices. </p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>In general, most of the current <code>common components</code> are reusable CDI Beans that you can directly refer to
  in your own CDI ManagedBeans, EJBs, JSF backing beans, and so on, using the standard dependency injection mechanism
  of JavaEE. By default, all the transaction attributes of these EJB components are &quot;Supports&quot;, leaving the
  transaction demarcation work to the clients. All the initial instance numbers of the EJBs are zero, so that MedRec
  does not have to create unnecessary instances and enlist related resources if the components are not used. All the
  maximum instance numbers of the EJBs are unlimited, which eliminates any potential thread contention in the EJBs.
</p>

<p>The following sections introduce the major components in various categories. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The information provided about these components is fairly brief because you are not required
  to understand the details and use of them in your own applications. See <a href="#add_resources">Additional
    Resources</a> for links to additional documentation about the components. </p>

<h2><a name="core"></a>Core </h2>

<p>The core components include general purpose components that do not use a specific Java EE API such as JMS or
  JPA. </p>

<p>These core components include simple CDI interceptors for caching, validation and logging. You can declaratively
  attach these interceptors to beans, making the features transparent to applications.
  These interceptors generally employ the Delegate design pattern, which means they delegate the actual
  implementations of the features to separate implementation provider components.
  This makes it easy to change the implementation using its configuration, rather than programming. Additionally,
  MedRec can get direct access to the implementation provider if it needs to programmatically use a feature. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Transparent Method Invocation Cache</strong>: Transparently caches the return values of business methods
    for Beans. A simple cache provider is provided by default, but a more sophisticated third-party cache provider
    can be incorporated as required. There is also a CDI Event Observer in the Cache manager. Local Cache is to
    refresh data when remote data of server has already been updated.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Transparent Method Parameter Validation</strong>: Automatically denies null method parameters for Beans.
    It is used by application entry points to check the parameter supplied by outer applications.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Transparent Exception Logging</strong>: Automatically logs exception information and stack traces for
    Beans. It is used by application entry points to record exceptions in the application logs before you
    see the exceptions.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Persistence </h2>

<p>Persistence is a critical feature of Java EE; MedRec provides support for JPA and JDBC. In particular: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>JPQL Support</strong>: MedRec includes a static util classes of JPQL support which simplify the
    implementation of services based on JPA named queries.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Criteria API Support</strong>: MedRec includes a static tool classes of Criteria API support which
    simplify the implementation of services based on the JPA Criteria API. It provides a number of static public
    helper methods that support various database operations and hide some of the complexity of the JPA APIs. Similar
    to JPQL, the Criteria API is based on the abstract schema of persistent entities, their relationships, and
    embedded objects. The Criteria API operates on this abstract schema to allow developers to find, modify, and
    delete persistent entities by invoking Java Persistence API entity operations. Moreover, both Metamodel and
    String are available as parameters of methods. The Metamodel API works in concert with the Criteria API to model
    persistent entity classes for Criteria queries.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Naming </h2>

<p>Although dependency injection is widely supported in Java EE, there are still many circumstances in which MedRec
  needs to get direct access to JNDI. For example, some technologies do not support DI, or a dynamic lookup is
  required. For this reason, MedRec includes some naming clients that act as gateways to JNDI:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Naming Client</strong>:
    Follows the traditional service locator pattern and wraps JNDI operations.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Caching Naming Client Decorator</strong>: Follows the decorator design pattern and adds object cache
    support to the <code>naming client</code>, using the <code>transparent method invocation cache </code>mentioned
    in the <a href="#core">Core</a> section and CDI Decorator. This feature significantly improves the overall
    lookup performance.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Messaging </h2>

<p>Although JMS is a flexible API, it can sometimes feel too low-level for daily use in common applications. For this
  reason, MedRec uses gateways to hide the complexity of these APIs and add some advanced features for common cases,
  while at the same time keeping the flexibility to work directly with low-level APIs. </p>

<p>Currently, two major features are implemented:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong> Message Client</strong>: Wraps the JMS APIs to implement various message exchange patterns (MEPs),
    including asynchronous one-way, synchronous request-reply, asynchronous request-reply, and so on, hiding the JMS
    APIs in most common cases<strong>.</strong> The feature includes a flexible automatic mapping between Java
    objects and the payloads of different types of JMS messages. It keeps track of the remote JMS connections,
    destinations, and so on, and transparently refreshes the stale remote references so that you do not have to
    restart your applications if the remote messaging systems are temporarily unavailable.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Message Listener Support</strong>:
        <span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">A series of abstract base classes from which implementations of
            <code>MessageListener</code> or MDB can directly inherit. </span>
    The classes provide support for
        <span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"> different MEPs including one-way, request-reply, and so on,
            without extra coding.</span>
    Like the message client, these classes also perform automatic mapping between Java Objects and JMS message
    playloads, and track remote JMS resources for transparent fault tolerance.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Mail</h2>

<p>MedRec uses a fairly simple <strong>Mail Client </strong> that serves as gateway to a mail system. </p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>MedRec implements a set of integration tests that are important to programmers who adopt agile practices for features
  such as EJBs. </p>

<p> Currently, only <strong>Integration Testing Support for JPA Repository</strong> is supported; this testing support
  significantly eases the testing of JPA <code>repositories</code> against actual databases but outside the EJB
  container. An abstract base JUnit test case is provided; this test case is responsible for instantiating and
  initializing the tested repositories, managing EntityManager and JDBC local transactions, and so on, to imitate the
  similar functionality provided by the EJB container. Actual
  test cases inherit from the base case and are not required to program the details themselves. </p>

<p>By default, transactions are always rolled back after each test method execution so that there is no need to manually
  clean up the database after the test. If, however, you want the changes in your test to be committed to the
  database, or you want to verify something that only happens at a commit, then you can change the default behavior by
  overriding the protected callback method.</p>
