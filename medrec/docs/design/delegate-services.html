<p>A <code>Delegate service</code> is one of the special types of services described in <a
    href="javascript:reloadTOC('design-overview.html')">Design Overview</a>. Delegate services have the same
  business interfaces as normal services do and these interfaces are completely business-oriented. The difference is
  that delegate services do not contain the actual implementations of the business functionality; rather, they use RMI
  stubs, JMS clients, Web services stubs, and so on, to dispatch invocations to remote business functionality. </p>

<p>The delegate services are also responsible for doing any required data model conversions, which means converting
  local entities and value objects to the data structures of the transfer mechanism, and vice versa. Using this
  approach, the remoting mechanisms are completely hidden from the clients. </p>

<p>Compared to the traditional approach, in which we get direct access to the specific remoting mechanism in our
  business components, the approach of delegate services provides the following benefits: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Programmers can freely change the remoting mechanisms or even switch to local service implementations without
    worrying about breaking the clients. Also, if programmers want to replace local services with remote
    functionality, they can simply have them become delegate services.
  </li>
  <li>If the contracts of the remote functionality (such as WSDL) change, programmers can simply change the delegate
    service implementations if the changes are isolated.
  </li>
  <li>Programmers can use consistent object models throughout the client applications, and they don’t have to mix and
    match local entities and value objects with tool-generated objects of Web services in the whole application.
  </li>
  <li>The service implementations that depend on remote functionality can be significantly simplified, and can
    concentrate on their own local logic. Also, if programmers want run unit tests, they can easily mock up the
    delegate services.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In MedRec, the delegate services are implemented as CDI beans, which call into JAX-WS dynamic to access remote Web
  services or use JAX-RS clients through Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to access remote REST resources. JAX-WS
  is used to do basic SOAP invocations, while Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style of
  client-server application centered around the transfer of representations of resources through requests and
  responses. In the REST architectural style, data and functionality are considered resources and are accessed using
  URIs, typically links on the Web.</p>

<p>The MedRec delegate services based on Web services simply reuse object models from the server-side application to
  avoid creating another set of local domain models (including entities, value objects, service interfaces, etc); this
  simplifies the implementations. It is important to note that this is <em>not</em> a best practice when designing
  real-world applications. If you chose Web Services as the remoting mechanism, the server and client are normally
  decoupled and WSDL is typically the only contract, which means that the client should have its own domain models.
  Otherwise, if the client shares the same Java object models with the server, Web services might not be the best
  choice, and you should consider using Java's native remoting mechanism like RMI, JAX-RS or some third-party solution
  like Spring HTTP Invoker, which would be more efficient and powerful.</p>

<p>Remote invocations are typically slower than local invocations; for this reason it is useful to cache the return
  values of some remote invocations to avoid unnecessary network trips. MedRec includes very basic cache support for
  the delegate services. MedRec declares the CDI interceptor of the transparent method invocation cache provided by
  common components on some &quot;read&quot; operations of the delegate services, and the values returned to the
  invokers will then be automatically cached. This is fairly typical usage of AOP to implement cross-cutting
  functionality. MedRec also uses CDI Interceptors attached to the &quot;write&quot; operations to make particular
  values in the cache become stale and automatically invalidate the stale ones. These interceptors are specific to
  business use cases. However, it needs to fire an event to notice refreshing cache when remote data has been
  updated</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The current cache support does not work in a clustered environment. </p>

<p>MedRec uses a delegate service that in turn uses JMS to trigger the mail sending function asynchronously. JMS is
  suitable for those scenarios in which interoperation, firewall, and so on are not important. The JMS-based delegate
  services use the message client from common components, which means their implementation is simple. </p>

<p>The transaction settings for the delegate services based on Web services, however, can be ignored because WebLogic
  Web Services do not support distributed transaction and its integration with JTA.</p>
