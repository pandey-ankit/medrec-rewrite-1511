<p>The MedRec application closely follows the standard industry trends, extensively utilizing some of the recent
  methodologies and technologies, in particular:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java SE/EE</li>
  <li>Domain-driven design (DDD)</li>
  <li>Aspect-oriented programming (AOP)</li>
  <li>Service-oriented architecture (SOA)</li>
  <li>Agile software development</li>
</ul>
<p>In sum, MedRec presents a comprehensive Java EE architectural guideline for WebLogic Server programmers and
  users.</p>

<p>The following sections provide a brief overview of the MedRec application design based on the previous
  considerations. For additional related technical resources, see <a href="#add_resources">Additional Resources</a>.
</p>

<h2>Design Highlights </h2>

<p>The MedRec application features these major design building blocks: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Common Components </strong>are technical components (such as EJB Components and CDI Beans) that are
    highly reusable across different projects. They can significantly improve the productivity of Java EE and
    enforce the use of best practices. Many MedRec application modules make extensive use of them.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Domain Models </strong>encapsulate the core business data and logic as well as their dependent
    functionality in object-oriented styles, constituting the heart of a domain-centric application. The domain
    models are classified into several types, most of which are EJB Components or CDI Beans:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Entities and value objects</strong> are rich objects that encapsulate both state and behavior,
        and represents business concepts, information of business situations, and business rules. The difference
        between <code>entity</code> and <code>value object</code> is that the former has distinct identity while
        the latter does not. Most of them are JPA mapped objects.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Gateways</strong> encapsulate the interactions with infrastructures (such as WebLogic Server),
        hiding the complexity of calling into APIs such as JMS, JNDI, JavaMail, Batch and so on.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Delegate Services </strong>are mainly responsible for mapping remote business functionality as
        local <code>services</code>, improving service composition in an SOA environment. They encapsulate the
        remoting mechanisms and perform necessary data model conversions, which in turn hides the details of
        distributed computing (such as remote interfaces and special data models) from clients.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Services </strong>define application workflow, directing <code>entities</code>, <code>value
        objects</code>, <code>gateways</code>, and so on to work out problems. They are thin objects and do not
        contain much business logic themselves. They are business-focused, and they rarely call into middleware
        APIs directly.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Facades</strong> are coarse-grained EJB components that act as wrappers for <code>services</code>.
    Facades are mainly responsible for exposing the <code>services</code> to remote clients. In MedRec, some
    additional <em>data transfer objects</em> are introduced to improve data transfer in a distributed environment.
    Additionally, various <em>facade brokers</em> are introduced to attach different protocol bindings, such as
    RMI/IIOP, JMS, JAX-WS, JAX-RS, and so on, to <code>facades</code>.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Web User Interfaces</strong> are responsible for interacting with the end users who use Web browsers as
    their clients. They are implemented as JSF Web applications, or as RESTful resources, or as Server Endpoints of
    Websocket, or as SSE handler and delegate the actual business processing to the <code>services</code> located
    in the same WebLogic Server instance.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Developer Tests</strong> are developed by the application developers instead of QA engineers, and are
    considered vitally important in agile software development. Both unit tests and integration tests are added to
    test all the aforementioned building blocks.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Build Process</strong> is responsible for managing the entire lifecycle of the project. This includes
    building, automated testing, reporting, deployment, distribution, and so on. The build process is based on Ant
    and Maven to simplify various things in a multi-module project.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>These featured build blocks are the foundation of the major MedRec application modules and the essentials of a Java
  EE server-side application. </p>

<h2>Layered Architecture</h2>

<p>In the MedRec application, the previous building blocks are organized in an architecture that consists of several
  clearly-defined layers: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Infrastructure Layer</strong> consists of infrastructure applications as application servers, database
    servers, and so on.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Domain Layer</strong> consists of <code>domain models</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Facade Layer </strong>consists of <code>facades</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Presentation Layer</strong> consists of <code>web user interfaces</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Client Layer </strong>consists of Web browsers and application clients. Application clients could be
    desktop GUI applications, external server-side applications, and so on.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram shows the basic architecture of the MedRec application.</p>

<p><img src="architecture1.jpg" width="500" height="400"/></p>

<p> The <code>domain layer</code> is the central piece of the server-side application. The <code>facade layer</code> and
  <code>presentation layer</code> are constructed around the <code>domain layer</code> to expose its functionality to
  different types of clients. <strong> </strong>The <code>facade layer</code> interacts with remote <code>application
    clients</code> (maybe also including some AJAX clients inside browser), while the <code>presentation
    layer</code> interacts with <code>browsers</code>. Unlike other architectures, the <code>presentation
    layer</code> here never calls into the <code>facade layer</code>, so these two layers are in a parallel
  relationship. </p>

<p>One could consider the <code>infrastructure layer</code> and <code>client layer</code> to be outside the boundary of
  a server-side application. Generally, only the upper layer depends on the lower layer within the same application
  (module), but not vice versa. </p>

<p><code>Common components</code>, <code>developer tests</code> and <code>build process</code> are typically involved in
  all the layers. </p>

<h2>Implementation Technologies</h2>

<p>The MedRec application uses Java EE (including Oracle add-on features) and Java SE technologies extensively. In
  addition, some third-party technologies are also introduced to implement the functionality that is not well covered
  by the standard Java platform as well as WebLogic Server. </p>

<p>The following graphic provides a summary on how the MedRec application uses the various technologies in its overall
  architecture. </p>

<p><img src="architecture2.jpg" width="500" height="400"/></p>

<p>Both the <code>domain layer</code> and <code>facade layer</code> make use of JAX-WS, JAX-RS, JMS, and so on, but the
  difference is that the <code>facade layer</code> mainly uses them to <em>expose</em> remote services, while the
  domain layer mainly uses them to <em>access</em> remote services. </p>

<p>The MedRec application does not use many third-party libraries, even though there are some excellent open source
  libraries available that would be very helpful. This is because the main focus of MedRec is to show how to program
  using Java EE on WebLogic Server. </p>
