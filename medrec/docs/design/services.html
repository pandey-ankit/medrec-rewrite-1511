<p><code>Services</code> are the final types in the domain model discussed in this section. Services serve as a sort of
  commander in the domain layer: they are responsible for maintaining the relationships of the various domain models,
  assembling them into a whole, and directing them to implement business functionality. </p>

<p>The services themselves mainly focus on business rather than actual technology. Their exposed interface methods
  usually map to business use cases or individual steps of the use cases; the set of methods of a service together
  make up a collection of use cases that are closely related to each other. Although the services can themselves
  contain business logic that does not necessarily belong to the instances of the entities or value objects, the
  services directly delegate most of the other logic to the instances. In other words, services should not contain all
  of the application logic, like the session beans in traditional Java EE do, because that typically leads to a
  procedure-oriented design, which can be fragile for complex applications. The services rarely touch the Java EE or
  similar technical APIs directly; rather, they delegate middleware operations to gateways, and delegate remoting to
  delegate services. Using this complex delegation model, applications achieve the desired separation of
  responsibility. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Although MedRec itself is not that complex of an application, it still follows these basic
  best practices. </p>

<p>The services are the major entry points of the domain layer, which means that almost all of the invocations to the
  domain layer should first go through a service. Services themselves do not directly handle remote invocations; those
  invocations should first go through the facades. The services completely hide persistences and gateways from the
  clients (e.g. facades and web user interfaces), but expose entities and value objects. The delegate services are a
  bit different, because they also expose business functionality as the normal services do. From the clients'
  perspectives, the delegate services are exactly the same as the services, so that they can also be directly exposed
  to clients. Put another way, the services and delegate services are in a parallel relationship.</p>

<p>The transaction attributes of the services are also different from the other types of the domain models. This is
  because services are the best places to demarcate transaction for the entire application. As already described,
  services are the major entry points to the domain layers, and their clients include facades, web user interfaces,
  etc. MedRec demarcates transactions on the services so as to use the EJB container-managed transaction and make the
  domain layer a full-fledged building block. In general, the service methods that get access, including indirect
  access, to transactional resources such as databases, message queue, etc, must be marked as &quot;Required&quot;, so
  as to ensure that JTA transactions are always started. There are, however, exceptions to this rule. For example,
  service methods that execute JPA queries that return large collections of objects are marked &quot;NotSupported&quot;
  so as to optimize the performance and increase the scalability of database access. Service methods that do nothing
  with transactional resources are marked &quot;Supports&quot; to avoid unnecessary transaction overhead. It is also
  possible to mark them &quot;NotSupported&quot; if you want to strictly prohibit transactional support and you do not
  care about the overhead of possibly suspending a transaction. </p>
