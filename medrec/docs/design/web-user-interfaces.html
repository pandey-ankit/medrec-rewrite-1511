<p>Like facades, Web user interfaces (or Web UIs for short) also serve as the entrance for remote clients, and reside in
  the boundary of the application. But these remote clients are mostly Web browsers manipulated by actual human
  beings, rather than other applications or services. </p>

<p>Unlike other Web applications, the MedRec Web UIs are responsible only for handling the Web-related presentation
  logic, just like the facades handle only remote invocation logic. MedRec Web UIs never contain the core business
  logic and never directly interact with the persistence APIs to access databases because, due to the MedRec layered
  architecture, there are backend domain models dedicated to this work. This architecture is very suitable to
  full-fledged enterprise applications, where the business logic is complex, advanced middleware services are
  required, multiple types of remote clients are present, and so on. </p>

<p>MedRec has very simple authorization requirements: only users that successfully log in can enter the Web application.
  MedRec uses filter servlets to intercept the requests to the protected URLS that match the predefined patterns and
  then check if the corresponding user exists in the HTTP session. If no correct user is found, the filter servlet
  redirects the requests to the login page for that type of user. This authorization mechanism is suitable for
  applications with relatively simple authorization requirements, such as MedRec; for more complex requirements, an
  application should implement a more sophisticated mechanism, use the security services provided by the container, or
  use a third-party security framework. The authentication of administrator just adopt container security services</p>

<h2>Java Server Faces </h2>

<p>In MedRec, the Web UIs are mostly based on the Java Server Faces (JSF) framework and follow the popular
  Model-View-Controller pattern. </p>

<p>The Model part mostly consists of our JSF backing beans. In MedRec, backing beans are referred to as <em>page
  controllers</em>, although they do not use the actual Page Controller pattern but rather, use the popular Front
  Controller pattern along with additional features of the Page Controller pattern. The page controllers are mainly
  responsible for handling user inputs, data validation, data conversion, and so on, as well as returning the
  resulting data, messages, etc to the Web client. They get access to the services to which they delegate the actual
  business processing by using dependency injection. Typically, a single page controller corresponds to one use case,
  although some page controllers contain actions for multiple use cases. This is because those use cases are closely
  related to each other, and we can simplify our implementations if we include them in a single class. </p>

<p>The page controllers normally require common technical features, such as getting I18N messages from resource bundles,
  invalidating sessions, etc, which the JSF technology does not provide support. To solve this issue, MedRec provides
  a PageContext object that wraps the JSF FacesContext object but provides additional convenience methods that hide
  the complexity of implementing these features. MedRec also provides an abstract base page controller from which all
  the page controllers of MedRec inherit and through which the page controllers get access to the PageContext object.
  The reasons for not putting the convenience methods into the abstract base page controller are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it is much easier to do unit testing against the page controller instances if a separate object includes the
    convenience methods, rather than having to deal with methods defined in the super class.
  </li>
  <li>It is easier for Web artifacts other than the page controllers, such as the filter servlet, to use these
    convenience methods if they are defined in the PageContext object.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: MedRec uses a variety of ways to work around known JSF limitations in the implementations of
  its Web UIs. For example, some page controllers store the return values of the services in the HTTP session because,
  in the JSF implementation used by Medrec, the JSF command link does not work properly inside a JSF data table.
  Depending on the implementation of JSF you use, you might find other solutions to these limitations.</p>

<p>The View part of the Model-View-Controller design pattern mostly consists of XHTML pages, which are responsible for
  rendering the actual UIs to users. The standard UI components of JSF are used extensively in these pages, and they
  are typically associated with the fields of the backend page controllers through the JSF expression language, so
  that the View part can exchange data with the Model part. Because of these UI components, MedRec rarely deals
  directly with HTML in the XHTML pages. Additionally, MedRec programmers can use an IDE to help with the
  component-based UI development, similar to standard desktop GUI development. Even without an IDE, these components
  alleviate the pain of creating XHTML pages because, compared to primitive XHTML, they have higher-level tags with a
  powerful expression language, making it easy to create elegant and readable pages by hand, similar to writing
  well-defined XML configuration files.</p>

<p>The Controller part of the Model-View-Controller design pattern is provided by the JSF framework, which features a
  front controller servlet dispatching the incoming requests according to the MedRec configurations. The standard
  <span class="style1">faces-config.xml</span> file defines all the page controllers and navigation rules that
  together assemble the Model, View, and Controller parts into a whole. The XML file also includes a custom JSF phase
  listener that transparently disables the browser's cache for all the HTTP responses from MedRec so that users never
  see stale pages.</p>

<p>MedRec provides I18n support so that users in different locales can view the pages in their native language. In the
  JSF-based Web UIs, all visible text is loaded from resource files that live outside of the Java code, regardless of
  whether the text is generated by the page listeners or XHTML pages. The name of the resource files all start with
  &quot;LocalizationResources&quot; and are added to the CLASSPATH of the Web applications with different suffixes. In
  general, one native language corresponds to one suffix; for example, Simplified Chinese corresponds to &quot;zh_CN&quot;.
  The Java I18N sub-system then looks for a message of a particular language based on the suffix. The page controllers
  load these messages using the convenience methods of the PageContext object; the XHTML pages load the messages using
  the JSF component tags. </p>

<h2>RESTful </h2>

<p>In MedRec, Batch scene adopts RESTful to manage report repository of statistics. Files are identified by URIs, which
  provide a global addressing space for resource and service discovery.</p>

<p>Resources are manipulated using a fixed set of four create, read, update, delete operations: PUT, GET, POST, and
  DELETE. PUT creates a new resource, which can be then deleted by using DELETE. GET retrieves the current state of a
  resource in some representation. POST transfers a new state onto a resource. It's convenient to request at
  JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Server-sent Event Handler</h2>

<p>In MedRec, at the same Batch scene, browsers get notice of finished files of statistics from server via SSE.</p>

<p>A server-sent event is when a web page automatically gets updates from a server. So it is well received at the scene
  of only pushing data from server. However, SSE can not satisfy your requirements of sending data from browser at the
  same time. If you expect bidirectional communication, Websocket is the best choice then.</p>

<h2>Server Endpoint Of Websocket </h2>

<p>In MedRec, it is no doubt that chat room is based on Websocket technology. MedRec uses Server Endpoints to handle
  diverse interactions.</p>

<p>In the traditional request-response model used in HTTP, the client requests resources, and the server provides
  responses. The exchange is always initiated by the client; the server cannot send any data without the client
  requesting it first. This model worked well for the World Wide Web when clients made occasional requests for
  documents that changed infrequently, but the limitations of this approach are increasingly relevant as content
  changes quickly and users expect a more interactive experience on the Web. The WebSocket protocol addresses these
  limitations by providing a full-duplex communication channel between the client and the server. Combined with other
  client technologies, such as JavaScript and HTML5, WebSocket enables web applications to deliver a richer user
  experience.</p>
