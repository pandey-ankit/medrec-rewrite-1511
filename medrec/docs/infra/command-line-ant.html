<h2>Highlighted Features</h2>

<p> In MedRec, each module has its own build file, which means each module can be built separately from the other
  modules. </p>

<h3><strong>Common Targets</strong></h3>

<p>The following build targets are common to all the modules:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong> build</strong>: Mostly compiles the Java source.</li>
  <li><strong>test</strong>: Runs the <code>developer tests</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>package</strong>: Packages the project artifacts into a complete archive, such as a WAR or EAR file.
  </li>
  <li><strong>install</strong>: Copies the packaged archive to a central repository so that it can be shared by the
    other projects.
  </li>
  <li><strong>deploy</strong>: Deploys the archive to WebLogic Server.</li>
  <li><strong>undeploy</strong>: Undeploys the archive from WebLogic Server.</li>
  <li><strong>clean</strong>: Removes all of the contents generated by the build process.</li>
</ul>
<p>These common targets are defined in a common build file called <code>module-build-commons.xml;</code>
  the individual build file of each module then imports this file to reuse the targets: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class="code"> <code>&lt;import file=&quot;../../module-build-commons.xml&quot;/&gt;</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The common build file also provides configuration and customization flexibility to satisfy the requirements of
  different modules. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Various configuration properties, such as the project directory layout, infrastructure information, build
    settings, and so on, can be easily customized globally using a global <code>project.properties</code> referenced
    by the common build file.
  </li>
  <li>The properties listed in the preceding bullet can also be overridden locally by the individual build file of
    each module. For example, we can easily customize the type of archive generated by the <code>package</code>
    target using <code>&lt;property name=&quot;archive.type&quot; value=&quot;war&quot;/&gt;</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Be sure to define the local properties <strong>before</strong> the <code>&lt;import&gt;</code>
        task to ensure that any property overrides take effect.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li> The common targets provide various extension points which can be used to easily hook up new functionality at
    certain points in the build process, or totally override the actual processing logic of a common target. These
    extension points are themselves also Ant targets.
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>For example, we can bring up the database server before running the JPA tests by overriding the
        <code>before.test</code> target, which is an empty callback target defined in the common
        build file. We can also completely change the regular compilation and packaging processes by overriding
        the <code>do.build</code> and <code>do.package</code> targets. It is not recommended to directly override
        the common targets themselves, such as <code>build</code> and <code>package</code>, because this may
        cause the build process to fail.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>By using the common targets, we can significantly simplify the individual build file of each module and in turn
  change the programmatic Ant build definitions to declarative ones. In fact, many of the modules' build files are so
  simple that they contain just a few configuration properties. Using this method we can also unify the targets
  exposed by each module, significantly simplifying their usage. </p>

<h3><a name="module_dependency"></a>Module Dependency Management </h3>

<p>Most of the MedRec modules have dependencies on other modules. Before building such a module using its build file,
  the dependent modules must be built automatically if you do not want to manually build all the dependent modules one
  by one. Therefore, a dependency management mechanism is added to the common targets. </p>

<p>Before the <code>build</code> target runs, it first looks for the dependent modules in a global
  configuration file called <code>module-dependencies.xm</code>l, and if any are found, it calls their
  <code>install </code> targets . If the dependent modules again depend on other modules, a recursive
  processing occurs to resolve all dependencies. The build will also ensure that any module is installed only once in
  the recursive process. The <code>install</code> target simply copies the generated archives, such as
  JAR files or WAR files, to the central repository (<code>@MEDREC_HOME/dist</code>), which is
  always on the CLASSPATH of the depending modules. This way the build dependencies are always resolved. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Unlike Maven, this feature manages only the internal dependencies of MedRec modules,
  but not the external dependencies. If you need a more comprehensive solution to module dependencies, you might
  consider using Maven instead of Ant.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>To build and deploy the entire MedRec application, complete the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open a command window and set your environment by running the <code>@SAMPLES_HOME/setExamplesEnv</code>
    script, where <code>SAMPLES_HOME</code> represents the main WebLogic Server Examples root directory, which by
    default is configured in <code>Oracle_Home/wlserver/samples/server</code>.
  </li>
  <li>Change to the <code>@MEDREC_HOME</code> directory, where <code>MEDREC_HOME</code>
    represents the directory in which the MedRec are configured. The default path is
    <code>Oracle_Home/wlserver/samples/server/medrec</code>.
  </li>
  <li>If you want a clean output directory, enter the following command:</li>
  <pre class="code"> <code>ant clean</code></pre>
  <li>To deploy the MedRec application, enter the following command:</li>
  <pre class="code"> <code>ant deploy</code></pre>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>By default, this target also runs the developer tests; if you do not want to run these tests, use the
      <code>ant -Dnotest=true deploy</code> command instead.</p>
    <p><b>Note</b>: due to different target types of each samples, deploy command only apply to Non-MT single server
      MedRec</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>To build an individual module of MedRec, such as <code>@MEDREC_HOME/modules/medrec/medrec-domain</code>,
  from that directory run the <span class="style1">ant</span> command:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class="code"> <code>ant</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This command builds, packages, and installs the module. As described in <a href="#module_dependency">Module
  Dependency Management</a>, the current module's dependent modules are automatically installed before its own install
  occurs. If, from a previous build, you know that the dependent modules have already been installed and they have not
  changed, you can use <code>ant -Dnodep=true</code> to skip the recursive processing of dependent
  modules to save time. </p>
