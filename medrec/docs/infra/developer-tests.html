<p>Developer tests play an increasingly important role in software projects; they are even critical for those projects
  adopting agile development processes. Typically, the application developer is responsible for creating these
  tests. </p>

<p>In MedRec, these tests can be divided into the following two major categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Unit tests</strong>: Unit tests concentrate on testing discrete units of the application; in Java the
    smallest unit is a method. Ideally, all the units in an application should be tested in isolation, or in other
    words, the tested units should not rely on the other units or external resources like the application server, a
    database, and so on when being tested. Mock objects, along with Dependency Injection, are helpful to achieve
    such isolation. <em>Mock objects </em>are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in
    controlled ways. Because of this isolation, unit tests typically run easily and quickly. A high percentage of
    unit test coverage for the application is essential to ensure the quality of the code.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Integration tests</strong>: From the perspective of a developer, however, unit tests are usually not
    adequate on their own because they always test against the application as an isolated unit, and cannot catch
    higher-level problems such as integration errors, system-wide issues, and so on. This is particularly true for
    Java EE applications that typically rely heavily on middleware services, databases, etc; verification of only
    the isolated in-memory logic is not enough quality assurance. This is where integration testing comes in.
    Integration tests also test a specific unit of the application, but test against real dependent units or
    external resources rather than testing against a mock object. For example, the integration tests for
    repositories use a real database so that the repositories, as well as the relevant entities/value-objects, are
    verified against a live database.
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>

    <p> The integration tests are required to run as easily and quickly as possible, which means that although they
      test against a live resource, it can be lightweight
      <!--, such as an embedded database in the preceding example-->. Additionally, the integration tests can also
      use mock objects to eliminate <em>unnecessary</em> dependencies, like the application server in the
      preceding example, since this resource is not important in the particular test. Integration tests do not
      have to integrate everything together, like an end-to-end functional test, but they do have to test against
      real objects when they are relevant to the test itself.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The developer tests can be run by the developers in many circumstances, such as inside an IDE, and they are typically
  incorporated into the application build process, so that they will be automatically executed by every build. This
  practice is essential to the continuous integration process. </p>

<p>In MedRec, the unit tests are based on the JUnit and EasyMock toolkits, which provide excellent support for test
  automation and dynamic mock objects. The unit tests mostly cover the services and facades in the domain models by
  verifying the related business logic and control flows. Most of the services and facades use field injection to get
  their dependencies, which is difficult to unit test, so MedRec adds additional setter methods for all the fields in
  the services and facades; the unit tests then replace the injected dependencies with the mock objects generated by
  EasyMock using these setters. </p>

<p>The other building blocks of the MedRec architecture, such as entities, value objects, JSF backing beans, and the
  common components, do not currently have any unit tests.</p>

<p>The business logic in MedRec is fairly simple, but the application depends heavily on databases, the application
  server, and so on, so integration tests are crucial. MedRec provides comprehensive integration tests for the
  repositories based on the JPA-repository-integration-testing support from the common components; the tests verify
  the whole JPA persistence layer against an<!-- embedded--> Derby database outside of the the WebLogic EJB container.
  The capability of being able to test outside of the Java EE container is critical for developer tests, because
  containers such as WebLogic EJB tend to be quite heavyweight and invasive, and it is much more difficult to create
  and run in-container tests in our daily development life. </p>

<p>The automated running of the MedRec integration tests requires the existence of a Derby service; Derby is bundled
  with WebLogic Server. Before the test is run, the build process executes an Ant target to start up the Derby server
  <!-- in embedded mode--> and create a dedicated database user and schema specifically for the tests. After the test
  executes, an Ant target deletes the user and schema to clean up the database. MedRec uses a different set of
  persistence configurations (in <code>persistence.xml</code>) for the integration test environment; these
  configurations specify a different transaction type (JDBC instead of JTA), database URL (points to the newly started
  <!-- embedded--> database), and user/password (according to the newly created user) from the ones in the normal
  production environment, so that the repositories as well as the related entities and value objects can work
  seamlessly in both development and production environments. </p>
