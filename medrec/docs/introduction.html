<h2>What is MedRec?</h2>

<p>
  Avitek Medical Records (or MedRec) is a WebLogic Server sample application suite
  that demonstrates all aspects of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE).
  MedRec is designed as an educational tool for all levels of Java EE developers.
  It showcases the use of each Java EE component, and illustrates best-practice design
  patterns for component interaction and client development. MedRec also illustrates
  best practices for developing and deploying applications with WebLogic Server on .
</p>

<h2>MedRec Application Overview</h2>


<p>MedRec provides a framework for patients, doctors, and administrators to manage patient data. Patient data
  includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Patient profile information</strong>: A patient's name, address, social security number, and login
    information.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Patient medical record</strong>: Details about a patient's visit with a physician, such as the patient's
    vital signs and symptoms as well as the physician's diagnosis and prescriptions.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The MedRec suite consists of 3 main Java EE application modules, each packaged as an EAR or a WAR:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>MedRec EAR</strong>: Patients log in this application to edit their profiles information, or request
    that their profiles are added to the system. Patients can also view prior medical records of visits with their
    physician. Administrators use this application to approve or deny new patient profile requests. The
    <code>medrec EAR</code> also provides all of the business logic used by the MedRec application suite, as well as
    the Web Services used by different clients.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Physician EAR</strong>: Physicians and nurses log in this application to search and access patient
    profiles, create and review patient medical records, and prescribe medicine to patients. The physician
    application is designed to communicate using the Web Services provided in <code>medrec EAR</code>.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Chat WAR</strong>: Physicians and patients chat with each other. One online physician, one opened chat
    room. There are two Websocket End Points, one for Patient, the other for Physician, and no web pages in this
    WAR. The <code>medrec EAR</code> and <code>physician EAR</code> contain chat room client connecting Websocket
    End Points with JavaScript.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Multitenant MedRec Domains</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Note</strong>: WebLogic Server Multitenant domain partitions are deprecated in WebLogic Server 12.2.1.4.0 and
  will be removed in the next release. Oracle recommends that customers using domain partitions as a container dedicated
  to specific applications and resources consider the use of alternative container-based architectures, including the
  deployment of WebLogic applications and services in Docker containers running in Kubernetes clusters.
  <strong>Multitenant MedRec domains are deprecated in WebLogic Server 12.2.1.4.0 and will be removed in the next release.</strong>
</p>

<p>In addition to the default single server domain, MedRec provides multi-tenant SaaS samples that run on three partitions, either on a single server or on a Coherence cluster. WebLogic Server Multi-Tenancy (WLS MT) provides resource isolation within a domain partition, which is an administrative and runtime slice of a WebLogic domain that is dedicated to running application instances and related resources for a tenant. Domain partitions achieve greater density by allowing application instances and related resources to share the domain, WebLogic Server itself, the Java virtual machine, and the operating system while isolating tenant-specific application data, configuration, and runtime traffic.

  <tr>
    <td>Default Single Server</td>
    <td>The default single server domain was installed if you chose the <b>Complete Installation</b> option when installing WebLogic Server, and then ran the Quick Start Configuration Wizard to install the WebLogic Server samples templates, then the MedRec domain has already been populated at <code>@MW_HOME/user_projects/domains/medrec</code>. For more information, see

<h2>Project Directory </h2>

<p>MedRec project files are installed into the <code><i>MEDREC_HOME</i></code> directory (<code><i>MEDREC_HOME</code></i> represents the directory in which the MedRec is configured).
<p>The default path is <code>@MW_HOME/wlserver/samples/server/medrec</code>.
  The project directory contains the following subdirectory structure:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>\dist</code>: Deployable archives (JAR, WAR and EAR) generated by the modules of the MedRec application.
  </li>
  <li><code>\docs</code>: Documentation about the MedRec application suite.</li>
  <li><code>\install</code>: Configures MedRec using WLST.</li>
  <li><code>\lib</code>: Dependent libraries that may not be automatically available from WebLogic Server's general
    CLASSPATH, set in the <code>@WL_HOME/server/bin/setWLSEnv</code> command.
  </li>
  <li><code>\modules</code>: Source files of the different modules
    <ul>
      <li><code>\common</code>: Common components used by the other modules</li>
      <li><code>\medrec</code>: Aforementioned <strong>MedRec EAR</strong></li>
      <li><code>\physician</code>: Aforementioned <strong>physician EAR</strong></li>
      <li><code>\chat</code>: Aforementioned <strong>chat WAR</strong></li>
      <li><code>\gar</code>: Coherence Cache GAR</li>
